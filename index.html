                <h2>COVID-19 UPDATE:</h2>
                <p>As the smallest of small businesses, professional photographers are often the hardest hit by the financial loss resulting from economic downturns. That is especially true with the current circumstances. In preparation for operating safely, I will adhere to the following guidelines as I follow state and local leaders’ phased-in efforts to re-open businesses:</p>
            
            
                <h3>ADHERENCE TO STATE & LOCAL GUIDELINES</h3> 
                <p>Above all, Ronnel Jones Photography believes in being good community citizens. By adhering to guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and the State of Nevada, I can reopen safely, and at the same time, contribute in to the emotional and financial healing process that needs to take place in a post-COVID-19 world.</p> 
            
                <h3>PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</h3>  
                <p>The use of PPE such as masks and gloves WILL be used while working with clients. I operate within the recommended measures continue through the end of phase three as outlined in recently released federal guidelines. Hand sanitizer and masks will be provided, if needed. The guidelines can be found at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/</p>
            
                <h3>SOCIAL DISTANCING</h3>    
                <p>Photographers should maintain social distancing, using no-touch posing methods when at all possible. Until further notice is received from the CDC and other health officials, the maximum gathering for a portrait shoot of 10 or fewer.</p>
            
                <h3>BY APPOINTMENT ONLY</h3>
                <p>Ronnel Jones Photography WILL hold to strict appointment times, allowing sufficient time to sanitize photographic equipment after each client session.</p>
            
                <h3>TEMPERATURE CHECKS & SCREENING QUESTIONS</h3>
                <p>Temperature checks and screenings WILL be conducted for each client (including each member of the family present) prior to each session. Any subject or family member with a fever exceeding 100.4 degrees should be rescheduled.</p>
